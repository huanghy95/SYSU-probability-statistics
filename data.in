Summary
Allow .desktop files to suggest how they are displayed and to displayed only if other files are not available.

Rationale
Kontact parts are current set to not display, they should be able to display only if Kontact is not installed.

Programmes can be branded or generic, currently we only display "Name (Generic Name)", .desktop file should be able to display if they want the Name shown, GenericName shown or both.
