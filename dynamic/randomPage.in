Intrepid Alpha 1 Delayed
According to the published Intrepid release schedule at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntrepidReleaseSchedule, the first Intrepid alpha was scheduled for June 12, 2008. Due to a number of factors, chief among them the current division of developer attention between the upcoming 8.04 point release and Intrepid, the alpha release was not made available as scheduled. Needless to say, every effort is being made to get an installable alpha image together in the coming days. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-June/000431.html

Global Bug Jam: How you can help make it happen!
The Ubuntu Global Bug Jam is going to be a big event, and the place to be the weekend of 08 August - 10 August, 2008. Make sure to contact your LoCo about this event to help coordinate efforts. Documentation on the event and how to organize it can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RunningBugJam.

Things you can do to help organize the event in your area:

If you know a good venue for the event, coordinate with your local friends and book it.
If you know your way around in Ubuntu Bug land, help your LoCo get started.

If you are an upstream developer and are interested in helping Ubuntu Bug Triagers to debug your application, sign up at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam, then add debugging information to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures

Ask your local friends what kind of packages, or class of bugs they're interested in, then post it here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam.

Developers should refer to this link to find out how they can make a difference: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2008-June/025533.html

Future Brainstorm Plans
Three months after the launch, it is time to do a small recap and lay out the plans for the next months. The project is now working towards better feedback to your input. Starting this cycle, there should be some regular developer feedback on popular ideas. In the next months, the work will be focused on an easier classification of ideas in projects, so that it can be exploited by non-Ubuntu software developers. Also coming is an easy way for Brainstorm users to contact each other, tools for Ubuntu developers to spot and keep track of the interesting ideas, and in the long run, the project is heading towards a project neutral release, but don't expect it too soon. http://blog.qa.ubuntu.com/node/12

Intrepid blueprints from the Ubuntu Server Team
With the end of UDS, members of the Ubuntu Server Team are busy writing specifications (aka blueprints) about topics discussed during the summit. Here is a non-exhaustive list of blueprints that are currently been written:

Gobuntu Future
The Gobuntu development team is announcing that after the 8.04 release of Gobuntu, the project will aim to merge many of the Gobuntu changes into mainline Ubuntu. One such merge would be their "Free Software Only" installer option, which only installs software considered free by the Free Software Foundation's definition of software freedom. The primary focus of the Ubuntu community, Canonical, and their derivative and downstream projects remains the success of free, Open Source software. It is hoped that by providing every Ubuntu user with the ability to install a completely free system, using the standard Ubuntu installer, we will move closer to a world of freedom, choice, and personal liberty with the hardware you own. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/gobuntu-devel/2008-June/000795.html

Ubuntu Forums Interviews
Second to IT professionals, UF Staff members are in the Medical or Life Sciences field. ugm6hr is one of the latter - a medical trainee from the UK. As many others, he started very early on with computers (around 7), in the Commodore Amigas era. Please meet with him here: http://kmandla.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/an-interview-with-ugm6hr/

Tutorial of the Week
This week's highlighted thread is a long-running emergency tip called "How to install Grub from a live Ubuntu cd," by catlett.

This is another tutorial that you hope you never have to use, but in the case that your MBR is damaged or you misbuild a dual-boot system, you'll want to know how to restore Grub. This thread -- which was first posted in 2006 -- can probably help, and all you'll need is a live CD and a little patience. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351

Have fun!

In The Press
Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva Performance Compared - After last weeks release of Phoronix Test Suite 1.0, one of the requests they received was to do a side-by-side comparison between the popular desktop Linux distributions. Ubuntu 8.04, Fedora 9, and Mandriva 2008.1 were chosen and it included 28 benchmark tests. Using the same hardware, and the standard default settings for each distribution gave the tests credibility, however some tests are just a comparison of Ubuntu 8.04 and Fedora 9. Ubuntu 8.04 won in 14 of the 28 tests. Mandriva 2008.1 won in three of the nine tests where it was used. Ubuntu won 10 of the 19 tests that were just between Ubuntu 8.04 and Fedora 9. As to which distribution is the fastest, from all of these tests and their varying results, it really depends what areas of the Linux desktop are important to you. You can see the details presented in graphic form at the link. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_3way_pts&num=1

Spawn of Ubuntu - It isn't enough just to create a great distribution these days, you also have to create a distribution that can spawn offspring to further that greatness. All the major distributions including Slackware, Red Hat, SUSE, Gentoo, and Debian have reproduced to the point where the children scarcely look like the parent. Now the children have grown up enough to begin procreating new and exciting distributions of their own for every whim and user type. Ubuntu is one of those prolific parents that has produced new offspring on a regular basis. A few new Ubuntu-based distributions have converted from other distributions to join the ever-growing Ubuntu family, and Ubuntu has also produced some nifty new desktop distributions of their own. http://www.linux-mag.com/id/6200

Ubuntu is early favorite in OpenLogic survey - A survey of open source software adoption, OpenLogic Inc.'s Open Source Census, has scanned more than a thousand computers to date. The objective of the survey is to help assist clients with support issues, and to attempt to quantify the actual usage of open source applications and their relative popularity. OpenLogic's Discovery Engine, which automatically identifies and inventories open source software, has searched 1,270 machines and detected open source software on about a third, or 478 computers. Of those computers with open source software, the leading operating system was Ubuntu, which was detected on 46% of all machines with open source software. http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid39_gci1317353,00.html

In The Blogosphere
Technology Today: Linux _ This blogger has recently become a self proclaimed Linux lover. Ubuntu 7.10 was impressive enough to convince her to completely make the change to Linux. In her review she discusses the pros and cons of switching. Pros include: customizable, price, ease of program installation, updates/support, VirtualBox/wine, and stability. Cons include: compatibility, availability at the retail level, and the learning curve. Conclusion: "All in all I have been very impressed with Ubuntu Linux 7.10 and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to learn a new operating system. Recently a new version of Ubuntu was released, 8.04, which improves further on the current iteration, and I hope to upgrade soon. I cannot imagine ever returning to Windows and look forward to the future as Linux becomes even better supported and more widespread." http://www.beckymckimmy.com/blog/2008/06/05/technology-today-linux-a-new-users-review/

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS still No. 1 for my laptop - Steven Rosenberg says, "Ubuntu 8.04 LTS is the best operating system I've ever run." So many things are working so well that he's reluctant to do anything but keep using this long-term support version of Ubuntu, which will have three years of updates and patches on the desktop. He has continued to try out the Live CDs of other distros, but nothing has been able to handle his particular collection of hardware better than Ubuntu 8.04. http://www.insidesocal.com/click/2008/06/ubuntu-804-lts-still-no-1-for.html

Tonight is Linux Night! - Christopher Dawson decided to put on a Linux night with his local computer club. The theme, Get Lucky on Friday the 13th with Linux! They got a local non-profit group to donate $400 towards a kit computer. The club kicked in another $100 for peripherals, and they had themselves a computer giveaway. The idea was to get people out on a Friday night, show them the cost saving of building their own computer, and introduce them to the advantages of Ubuntu. They also burned Ubuntu CDs to give away to anyone who showed up. http://education.zdnet.com/?p=1727

Mark Shuttleworth responds to unfounded rumors
A recent article at http://boycottnovell.com/2008/06/07/ubuntu-remix-codecs/ indicated that Ubuntu, and in particular, Mark Shuttleworth, had negotiated privately with Microsoft for proprietary codecs. This article started a debate that spilled over to one of the mailing lists. Within 24 hours, Mark posted replies in the negative to both the original article and mailing list.

The original article was referring to Canonical's recent announcement of its netbook remix platform that the company is working on with OEMs for the growing sub-notebook market. In order to protect themselves, and the customers purchasing their devices, those OEMs would naturally wish to make sure that media is "legally" playable. This is a standard industry practice, and a good example would be Dell's underwriting the cost of said codecs for the computers they sell that are pre-installed with the Ubuntu.

What needs to be understood is that netbook remix is maintained by Canonical, and not the Ubuntu community, and there is no intention to include proprietary codecs into the standard Ubuntu release. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-discuss/2008-June/004510.html

Open source snub in UK schools
International big hitters had piled behind UK open source houses bidding for the Becta contract to set up an open source community in the schools sector. But Becta gave the open source community a surprise when it turned down their bids and awarded the business to a consultancy with no links to the open source community.

Becta said in a written statement: "Bids were invited and, following an evaluation process, the contract has been awarded to The Alphaplus Consultancy(Manchester)." It did not say why Alphaplus had been chosen over a line-up of prime open source bidders, but Mark Taylor, president of the Open Source Consortium, and whose consultancy Sirius bid for the work, said it was a mistake. "They've chosen the worst possible candidate because Alphaplus has no open source experience whatsoever," said Taylor.

John Winkley, a director of Alphaplus, said he wanted to clear his comments with Becta before saying what his firm could bring to the UK's schools open source community. But he refuted the allegation that Alphaplus wasn't qualified to do the work: "I think we are and Becta clearly thinks we are," he said. The open source community has long complained that the odds were stacked against them in the UKs public sector. One of the losing bidders was The Learning Machine, an open source schools specialist. The Learning Machine was backed by Canonical. http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/06/12/open-source-snub-uk-schools

Vienna failed to migrate to GNU/Linux: why?
Despite the announcement of several governments and councils concerning multi-year migration plans to GNU/Linux, some of those plans crumbled. But why? The City of Vienna made several crucial mistakes in their bid to migrate to open source. First, they tried to develop and implement their own distribution, instead of using an established, easy to use, stable one, like Ubuntu. Second, they thought they could depend on wine for certain already in use proprietary programs, which didn't work. The third problem is in direct relation to the first problem, they ran into hardware compatibility problems because they tried to develop their own distribution. Finally, the moment the city announced their decision to migrate to open source, Microsoft's "damage control" machine started. The conclusion: The City of Vienna might well be a lost cause, but it is hoped that other IT managers can avoid making the same mistakes. The presence of a strong desktop distribution (Ubuntu) will hopefully simplify things. However, in the end IT managers need to accept that most of the world will eventually start migrating to open standards and free software. http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/vienna_failed_to_migrate_to_linux_why

Mark Shuttleworth on the future of Ubuntu
The life of South African Mark Shuttleworth has been a kind of geek dream according to Glyn Moody, who talked with the Ubuntu founder and CEO recently. The discussion included talking about what led to the startup of Ubuntu after selling off Thawte Consulting to Verisign in 1999, Ubuntu's shift in strategy to address the server side, concern that Ubuntu is spreading itself to thin, and coordinating releases amongst the GNU/Linux distributions. Will computing in the cloud be a threat or an opportunity for Ubuntu? What is Mark's stand on including some proprietary elements in a free software distribution? Might KDE one day replace GNOME as the standard Ubuntu desktop? And finally, what would happen to Canonical and Ubuntu if Mark happened to fall out of a spaceship? All in all, a great interview that everyone should read. http://lwn.net/Articles/284760/

Siemens gets serious about open source
Siemens outsourcing unit is snapping up some of South Africa's brightest open source minds as it readies to offer large-scale open source services to clients. One of those niches, says Felix Honigwachs, head of Siemens' open source center of competency, is the South African public sector. Siemens already has relationships with a number of government departments including the departments of science and technology and labour. Recently, however, Siemens identified open source as having a very viable business case. Siemens already has in place partnerships and agreements with Red Hat, Canonical and enterprise content management suite providers Alfresco. On the desktop, Honigwachs says that the unit plans to offer either Red Hat or Ubuntu. "In government there is a preference for Ubuntu. We like Ubuntu and we have good quality skills on Ubuntu," he says. http://www.tectonic.co.za/?p=2489

Linux-Magazine Italia interviews Mark Shuttleworth
Vincenzo Ciaglia from Linux-Magazine Italia sent Mark Shuttleworth a few questions related to the release of 8.04 LTS. Since Vincenzo was going to translate the conversation into Italian, he agreed to let Mark post the English version on his blog. The interview included question about Canonical, Ubuntu 8.04, hardware and wireless issues, improvements to server edition, virtualization solutions, Debian, embedded devices, and much, much more. http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/148
